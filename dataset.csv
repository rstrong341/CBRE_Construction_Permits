(There is only one two-story building at this location.) Repairs to the cement stucco finishes are twofold, they are required due water infiltration at point where this finish material is in close proximity to adjacent roof surfaces and that are not properly designed originally with the correct flashing and ventilation. Repairs to the stucco will take place at areas of water damage and in areas that will improve the flashing detailing of the wall /roof intersection. Repairs to the cementitious shingles system are related to the lack of proper flashing at the ground level window units. It has bee determined that a previous window replacement project did not with adequately provide for flashings and waterproofing or there was very poor installation of the same. These conditions have led to failure of the untreated wood window trim. All lower level windows will have the shake shingles removed to provide access to the adjacent wall surfaces for installation of new flashings and waterproofing systems and replacement of the perimeter wood window trim with new cedar trim. A select number of window units that have also failed due to wind damage or lost seals are to be replaced during this scope of work as well -this is approximately a dozen window units. Lastly all wall surfaces will be repainted after repairs are completed.",2021/04/27 06:59:59+00,7137.0,Crossroads,Crossroads,Nonresidential,[O] Office,210442.0
